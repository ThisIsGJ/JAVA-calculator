\f0\fs28 \cf0 If you want to  extend the system to include other mathematical  operators you should have next 3 steps:\
\
step1:  add button which is used to show the operator in the frame to makeFrame() method in UserInterface class.\
\
step2:  add the operator function in the actionPerformed() method. If it is necessary, we also need write some 		method in BasicOperation.\
\
step3:  after you have finished all the step1 and step2, you could try to run the system and fix all the problem the 	  	system have. \
